  <div id="content">
    

<h2 id="tl-dr">TL;DR</h2>

<p>AWS Lightsail is a really interesting concept for small businesses and developers looking to spin up a server without the added complexity of a full EC2 instance. However, the lack of complexity means a lack of configurability, so if you have even slightly complex requirements, Lightsail is not for you.</p>

<h2 id="background">Background</h2>

<p>I&rsquo;ve been hosting sites for small local businesses and friends &amp; family for quite some time now. I once had a short but torrid love affair with Umbraco as a CMS, and most of the sites I created (I don&rsquo;t do new sites now, just maintain the old ones) were Umbraco-based. As such, I need a Windows-based host to serve the sites.</p>

<p>I used to be a sysadmin in a medium-sized company where I lead the change from physical servers (~50) to a 3-node VSphere cluster. I fell in love with virtualisation from the moment I first played around with it. No longer did I want some cpanel-based abomination for websites. No more remote installation of Wordpress. I could have a &ldquo;real&rdquo; server and develop new sites in whatever language I wanted. I was a Windows admin (mostly) and had recently started experimenting with C#. I wanted a C#-based CMS.</p>

<h3 id="c-cms">C# CMS</h3>

<p>First, I tried <a href="http://www.dnnsoftware.com/">DotNetNuke</a>. It worked, but it wasn&rsquo;t pretty. Getting custom content into a good-looking template was not as easy as I had hoped. I was pretty green at this stage, but I knew there had to be something out there where my templates didn&rsquo;t look like spaghetti and content authors didn&rsquo;t have to have a degree in Computer Science to be able to add or edit content.</p>

<p>Then I stumbled across <a href="https://umbraco.com/">Umbraco</a>. This looked to be the answer to all my dreams. I am using <a href="https://gohugo.io/">Hugo</a> now, so obviously it didn&rsquo;t continue to answer <em>all</em> of my dreams; it just did back then.</p>

<p>I could create custom content and pages types, and I could write in C#. I could open the site in Visual Studio to code, or I could log into the Umbraco back-end and edit things live. Content-editing was a simple, form-based exercise. Anyone could manage it. I was hooked.</p>

<p>I ended up building many sites, and I still support around 5-6 sites now. All but one of those sites are Umbraco-based. That means I still need a Windows environment to host in, and I still need a SQL back-end.</p>

<h3 id="my-first-virtual-private-server-vps">My first Virtual Private Server (VPS)</h3>

<p>When I first wanted a VPS, I looked for the cheapest option I could find that supported Windows and would accept PayPal. I found <a href="https://corgitech.com">CorgiTech</a> which was still a fledgling business at that stage.</p>

<p>For less than £20 per month I could rent a VPS all of my own, set up sites and administer my own server. Yes, it was pretty low in terms of specification, but my clients were not running anything other than brochure sites so I wasn&rsquo;t expecting much in the way of traffic. Density was the name of the game, so I wanted something that would allow me to squeeze all websites into a single VPS - I appreciate that redundancy was not something I had planned in at that stage, but these were not business-critical applications.</p>

<p>I am still with Corgitech now, using a slightly higher-specification VPS, and I still host a number of legacy Umbraco sites there now, along with some static sites.</p>

<p>Today I decided that I had stalled long enough. I had a couple of free hours which I was going to utilise to migrate all the sites to AWS. Yes, it might cost me a little more, but the features available to me in AWS are the best-in-class (for the most part&hellip;). If I could combine all of my sites into one AWS account, and one billing cycle, I could start to consolidate.</p>

<p>When I was about to spin up a new EC2 instance to start, I spotted a banner ad in the AWS Console:</p>

<p><img src="/img/2017/11/try-lightsail.png" alt="Try Lightsail" /></p>

<p>I am embarrassed to admit that I hadn&rsquo;t even heard of Lightsail until this point. These things often seem to happen to me - I don&rsquo;t know something exists until I need it (or might do) and then all of a sudden it appears as if from nowhere&hellip;</p>

<p>I decided to spin up an instance and try it out - I had nothing to lose.</p>

<h3 id="spinning-up-an-instance">Spinning up an instance</h3>

<p>Spinning up a new instance was so easy. Pick an OS (Windows in this instance, but plenty of *nix distros are available too), pick a size, that&rsquo;s it.</p>

<p>You even get a static IP address that is free as long as your instance is powered on. The observant amongst you will of course realise this means it&rsquo;s not free when it&rsquo;s not attached to an instance&hellip;</p>

<p><img src="/img/2017/11/pick-an-instance.png" alt="Pick an instance" /></p>

<p>I chose Windows (2016) - might as well choose the latest version if I&rsquo;m trying something new.</p>

<p><img src="/img/2017/11/choose-size.png" alt="Pick a size" /></p>

<p>Now I needed to pick a size. The first option is free for the first month (750 hours). Nothing is cheaper than free, so of course that&rsquo;s the option I selected.</p>

<p>Now press <code>Create</code>, wait a couple of minutes&hellip;. boom. New server. So far, so good. This couldn&rsquo;t have been easier to get going with. I literally only had 3 decisions to make:</p>

<ul>
<li>which region</li>
<li>which OS</li>
<li>what size</li>
</ul>

<h3 id="accessing-the-instance">Accessing the instance</h3>

<p>Now the instance is powered on and I&rsquo;ve recovered the auto-generated password I can RDP into it via either the portal or using my own RDP client. Port 3389 is open by default (more on that later) and the RDP console built into portal has all the features I could ask for.</p>

<p>This is the point where I realised, somewhat belatedly, that 500MB of RAM is simply not sufficient to run anything in Windows. Both CPU and RAM were pegged at pretty much 100% as soon as I tried to do anything. This wasn&rsquo;t completely unexpected.</p>

<p>My next thought was to upgrade to the next tier. Should be as simple as a click in the portal, surely? Not so.</p>

<p>To upgrade to the next tier, I had to:</p>

<ol>
<li>Sysprep the instance</li>
<li>Shut it down</li>
<li>Create a new snapshot</li>
<li>Detach the IP address</li>
<li>Provision a new, bigger instance from the snapshot</li>
</ol>

<p>Doesn&rsquo;t sound like a huge amount of work, especially as I can take care of it all with a few mouse-clicks in the portal. However, should I choose to scale the instance down in the future I will be stuck. I cannot scale it down. I can only provision an instance from a snapshot where the size is the same or larger than the size of machine used to create the snapshot. See <a href="https://aws.amazon.com/premiumsupport/knowledge-center/change-lightsail-plan/">https://aws.amazon.com/premiumsupport/knowledge-center/change-lightsail-plan/</a>.</p>

<p>For maximum flexibility, I would have to complete the setup of my VM whilst at the smallest specification and <em>then</em> create an image of it. That image could then be provisioned at any size. But what if I want to make any subsequent changes? The image would be no good.</p>

<p>This mean that lightsail is really only suitable for small scale projects without a lot of changes to configuration. And, once you&rsquo;ve scaled up, unless you planned for it in advance; you&rsquo;re not scaling down again.</p>

<h3 id="firewall-rules">Firewall rules</h3>

<p>The UI for adding new firewall exceptions is clean and uncluttered, but it lacks what I&rsquo;ve come to expect as basic functionality. I can, for example, open port 3389 for RDP. I cannot restrict the IP address(es) that the port it open to, however. I&rsquo;ve been burned by that in the past - leaving that port open is like sending out an invitation to all the world&rsquo;s script kiddies just asking to have your VM encrypted and be held to ransom. It&rsquo;s a huge security oversight.</p>

<p>The only way around this, if you need to be able to administer your VM, would be to:</p>

<ol>
<li>Log into the portal</li>
<li>Add a new firewall exception for RDP</li>
<li>Log on remotely and make your change</li>
<li>Log off</li>
<li>Remove the firewall exception from the portal</li>
</ol>

<p>This seems clunky to me, especially compared to the AWS endpoint administration tool where it can even detect my current IP address and allow me to add a rule to just allow connections to specific ports for specific origin IPs.</p>

<h3 id="load-balancing">Load balancing</h3>

<p>Unfortunately, this doesn&rsquo;t even seem to be an option. I appreciate that the target market probably doesn&rsquo;t want the complexity of load balancing, but still&hellip; even with the most simple of dynamic sites these days I still want the ability to do a rolling update or balance traffic during spikes. Given the difficulty with reducing the sizes of instances, I can hardly scale up then back down quickly in response to a traffic spike.</p>

<h3 id="summary">Summary</h3>

<p>It&rsquo;s a cool idea with a limited target market. For spinning up instances quickly to test things in the cloud it could be the ideal solution - it&rsquo;s quick, simple and cheap.</p>

<p>For anything more complex than a simple blog site, I strongly believe that you&rsquo;re better off sticking with full on AWS or Azure.</p>
