      <description>TL;DR AWS Lightsail is a really interesting concept for small businesses and developers looking to spin up a server without the added complexity of a full EC2 instance. However, the lack of complexity means a lack of configurability, so if you have even slightly complex requirements, Lightsail is not for you.
Background I&amp;rsquo;ve been hosting sites for small local businesses and friends &amp;amp; family for quite some time now. I once had a short but torrid love affair with Umbraco as a CMS, and most of the sites I created (I don&amp;rsquo;t do new sites now, just maintain the old ones) were Umbraco-based.</description>
